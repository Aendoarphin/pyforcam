# Tool Life Utility
A utility desktop app to visualize contents of xml files. This is being used by Baskins Machined Products to help CNC machine operators keep track of production information.

## Program Details
Each machine represents one url and the program makes looping requests for each given url. The urls give an xml response which also contain multiple tool numbers. These tool numbers contain values needed to be displayed onto a table for the operators to see in the shop.

## Machine Data
The repo contains sample xml files for demonstration purposes, but this is actively being used under BMP's internal network.
